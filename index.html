                It seemed like any other day on September 4, 1981, the birds chirped, kids hurried off to school and in Houston, Texas Tina 
                Tina Knowles would go on to deliver her first born Beyonce Giselle Cater-Knowles. As young Bey grew a dance teacher noticed
                Bey's ability to sing when she started humming a song and Beyonce finished it, hitting the high notes. Over the years Beyonce
                continued refining her craft by attending performance art schools, participating in choirs and competing in local talent shows.
                It was through such shows that Beyonce came to join her first girls group <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYZA4VOnpPk">
                Girl's Tyme</a></em> in 1990, click on the video to see their performance on Star Search the largest talent show on national TV at the time. 
                Girl's Tyme failed to win, later in 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group and the group changed their 
                name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

                In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song "Killing Time" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.
                The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album scoring their first major hit. The group released their 
                Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999 earning them the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with 
                Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. Shortly after two members LeToya Luckett and Roberson left 
                the group and sued Mr. Knowles for mismanagement. After being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for it's 
                spilt, Beyonce entered into a depressive state.
