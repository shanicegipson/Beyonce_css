            "Long Live the Queen!" I wanted to practice css so I thought why not build a website dedicated to my queen, the queen Beyonce 
            Giselle Cater-Knowles.

                It seemed like any other day on September 4, 1981, the birds chirped, kids hurried off to school and in Houston, Texas Tina 
                Tina Knowles would go on to deliver her first born Beyonce Giselle Cater-Knowles. As young Bey grew a dance teacher noticed
                Bey's ability to sing when she started humming a song and Beyonce finished it, hitting the high notes. Over the years Beyonce
                continued refining her craft by attending performance art schools, participating in choirs and competing in local talent shows.
